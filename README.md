# Multi-segment_Customer-Clustering
This project uses K-Means clustering in Python to segment customers based on demographic and behavioral data. After preprocessing and feature scaling, users are grouped into five distinct clusters.

Includes EDA, multiple visualizations, and a Streamlit app for automated segmentation and downloadable results.
The dataset includes features such as age, gender, income, education, location, device usage, weekday/weekend activity, click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, ad interaction time, likes, follows, and top interests.
Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and applying feature scaling to ensure optimal clustering performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using correlation heatmaps, histograms, box plots, bar charts, pair plots, and cluster scatter visualizations to better understand feature distributions and relationships.
Each cluster represents a distinct user persona with shared behavioral and demographic patterns, enabling clearer interpretation of customer behavior.
This approach is highly beneficial for modern businesses as it supports personalized marketing campaigns, better product recommendations, improved customer retention strategies, and efficient resource allocation.
By identifying meaningful user segments, organizations can make data-driven decisions and improve customer engagement.
The project also includes an interactive Streamlit web application that makes the model easy to use without requiring deep technical knowledge.
Users can upload their own customer datasets, view preprocessing summaries, generate clusters instantly, and explore interactive visualizations directly in the browser.
The app displays cluster-wise demographic analysis, feature comparisons, and labeled segmentation outputs.
It also provides options to download the segmented dataset for further reporting or integration into business workflows.
This ensures scalability, usability, and practical deployment of the clustering model in real-world scenarios.
The interactive Streamlit app is deployed and publicly accessible at:
